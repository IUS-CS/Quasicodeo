# Project Proposal

The purpose of this project is to allow users the opportunity to plan their financial success while
watching it develop in real time. A user can also use this for a specific goal, for life in general,
or both.

## Internal Technologies

TooBroke will be a web application using the MVC core framework. This will utilize C#, Razor, and
a SQL server hosted on the Azure service. Some JavaScript will also be implemented for field verification.

## Features

Users would have a login so pertinent information could be saved. Users will have access to 
making and joining groups of other users that they would like to schedule time with. There will be
options to create and edit your personal schedule while including information like drive times.
With time allowing, we plan to add additional embellishments. This could include something like
the ability to create a specific meeting construct with a location, time, notifications/reminders, 
and response functionality.

New users will need to register with our service in order to properly store and track their financial 
needs. Once they have joined, they will be able to utilize any and all of the available calculators, to 
include: Budget planner, Savings calculator, Debt calculator, and Goal planning.

## External Technologies

We are considering use of the Google Calendar API to allow users to enable notifications for due dates
on debt payments.

## Example Use

A user may create a budget for the month, providing their expected income and creating categories to which 
their expected expenditures can be collected. Through the purchase logging screen, the user may add their 
purchases into the service with a category in order to track their expenditures. Over the course of the month,
the user may check their progress in their budget and detect any areas which may be problematic for success. 
Finally, they can look at a full distribution of their expenditures to see where they may adjust their next 
month's budget appropriately.
